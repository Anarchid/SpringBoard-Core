## Installing

The simplest way to download and install SpringBoard is use one of the packaged builds:
- [Windows build](http://spring-launcher.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/Spring-SpringBoard/SpringBoard-Core/SpringBoard%201.1013.0.exe)
- [Linux build ](http://spring-launcher.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/Spring-SpringBoard/SpringBoard-Core/SpringBoard%201.1013.0.AppImage)

See [detailed instructions](http://springboard-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html)

The automated downloader is currently broken, and the recommendation is to follow the manual installation steps: https://springboard-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html#manual-setup

### Game-specific modules
This is the core module, you may still want to get additional game-specific modules if you're making a scenario.

Some examples:
- https://github.com/Spring-SpringBoard/SpringBoard-BA
- https://github.com/Spring-SpringBoard/SpringBoard-ZK
- https://github.com/Spring-SpringBoard/SpringBoard-EVO
- https://github.com/Spring-SpringBoard/SpringBoard-S44

## Assets

All assets (texture files, skyboxes, etc.) should be placed in the `springboard/assets` folder, located inside the Spring data directory.

A set of [core assets](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9FQjbVMFgL2LTM2Z1VVaGRZRDQ/view?usp=sharing) are available. To use, extract them to `springboard/assets/core/`.
