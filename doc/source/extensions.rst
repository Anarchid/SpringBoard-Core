Extensions
==========

SpringBoard support editor extensions. They should be created in separate folders, in the SB_PATH/exts folder, and they consist of two subfolders:

- **ui**. This is where you should place all strictly unsynced extensions, like the Editor GUI and States.
- **cmd**. This folder should contain files that should be shared by both synced and unsynced extensions, like Command and Model.

Consult the API docs for details.

Example extensions:

.. TODO: Link ZK metal editing extension

.. TODO: This section

While SpringBoard offers powerful editing capabilities out of the box, there are a number of ways it can be further extended. These include:

- **[Assets](https://github.com/Spring-SpringBoard/SpringBoard-Core/wiki/Assets).**
- **[Extensions](https://github.com/Spring-SpringBoard/SpringBoard-Core/wiki/Extensions).**
- **[Meta-programming](https://github.com/Spring-SpringBoard/SpringBoard-Core/wiki/Meta-programming).**
