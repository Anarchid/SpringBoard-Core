SpringBoard: Editor for Spring
==============================

SpringBoard is an in-game editor for the `SpringRTS <https://springrts.com/>`_ engine, and it can be used to develop maps and scenarios.

Installing
----------

The simplest way to download and install SpringBoard is use one of the packaged builds:
