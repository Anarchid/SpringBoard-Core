Feature comparison
==================

Here we present a comparison between SpringBoard and other scenario and map editing software.

Spring tools
------------

The most popular alternative for a scenario editor in the SpringRTS ecosystem is the Zero-K Mission Editor (ZKME) `(link) <https://zero-k.info/Wiki/MissionEditorStartPage>`_.
It is primarily designed for Zero-K, but it has basic support for other games with similar mechanics.

Comparing SpringBoard to ZKME:
- ZKME runs as an external tool, while SpringBoard runs in-engine. This allows SpringBoard to offer WYSIWYG kind of editing, and also use camera controls that players are already familiar with.
- ZKME doesn't support expressions in functions and actions. This makes it impossible to write complex conditions and actions, which limits expressibility.
- ZKME doesn't support variables which makes storing values difficult.
- ZKME only runs on Windows, while SpringBoard supports all platforms that work with the SpringRTS engine.
