SpringBoard: Editor for Spring
===============

Detailed (outdated) docs can be found: http://spring-springboard.github.io/SpringBoard-Core/

This is just the core module, you still need a game-specific one.

Installing (in your Spring games folder):
git clone --recursive https://github.com/gajop/SpringBoard.git SpringBoard.sdd
(--recursive call will pick up submodules)

You should also get the game-specific module! Examples:
https://github.com/gajop/SpringBoard-BA
https://github.com/gajop/SpringBoard-ZK
https://github.com/gajop/SpringBoard-EVO
